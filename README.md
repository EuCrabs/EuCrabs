Hello, I'm Evgeniy. It is my github profile where I try to learn some languages (Python and Java) for my own targets.
I'm an quality assurance engineer and currently work at Mission:Luna as a manual QA.
I like learn new ways in IT and try programming.

Test automation is not my dream, but I'll exactly involve in it.

I'd like to became a super specialist with really good hard skills and perfect soft skills.

Building a stable development process is my uphold the goal!
